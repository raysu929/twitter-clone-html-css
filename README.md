 Old Twitter Clone (HTML and CSS)

This is a recreation of the old Twitter homepage (around 2010), built using only HTML and CSS.  
I made this as part of a practice exercise after completing a full HTML & CSS course on YouTube. I wanted to test how well I could build a layout from scratch â€” no templates, no outside help, just me.

- HTML
- CSS
- Google Font
- Flexbox + Grid
- Position Relative and Absolute
- CSS reset

What I Practiced:
- Structuring a page layout without relying on tutorials
- Styling elements to match the 2010 twitter
- Positioning (which I used to struggle with â€” this helped a lot)
- Deploying to GitHub Pages

- 
This was a solo project I built without Googling for help.  
I learned a lot just figuring things out as I went, especially when it came to positioning elements, creating consistent spacing, and working with images.
